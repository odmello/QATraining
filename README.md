QATraining
==========

A place for us to do some hands on training.

This repository may contain QA notes.

My thoughts are that we should create a few different files in a number of different formats (Google: docs, spreadsheet, drawing), make some changes in our working directories, and commit them.
Then play around with the review process (push, merge, sync, ???, issues, bugs)

- create your own branches and add docs (e.g. odmello-spreadsheet) and then ??? merge back into the Master?
- I will try to delete the SQL text file that I added to the Master and creat a branc for it and try a merge?
