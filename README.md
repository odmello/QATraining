QATraining
==========

A place for us to do some hands on training.

This repository may contain QA notes.

My thoughts are that we should create a few different files in a number of different formats (Google: docs, spreadsheet, drawing), make some changes in our working directories, and commit them.
Then play around with the review process (push, merge, sync, ???, issues, bugs)
